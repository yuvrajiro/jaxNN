# jaxNN : A JAX-based Neural Network :page_facing_up:

I always wanted to build a neural network, but I didn't know how to do it. 
Then I got to know JAX Library which is super efficient and easy to use. I 
knew how Neural Networks work, but I didn't know how to build them. So i 
started this project to learn how to build a neural network. JAX grad is a 
great help to me. 

I wanted this project is easy to understand and easy to use. So I decided 
to make it from Scratch so that newcomers can understand how to build a 
Neural Network , This leads to a very simple code. 

TO DO:  
:point_right: Build a Neural Network  
:point_right: Make an Animataion of the Neural Network which shows up while   
training so that the user can see how the Neural Network is training.  
:point_right: Use TQDM to show the progress of the training.  
:point_right: Add different Layers  
:point_right: Write Documentation so that anyone can understand how to use ,
and update their code according to thier needs.  
:point_right: Add W&B to the project so that the user can see the progress

## About Me

I am a Research Scholar at Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati in the 
Department of Mathematics, earlier I was doing my Masters in Statistics and 
Computing at Banaras Hindu University at the Centre for Interdiscplinary 
Mathematical Sciences (CIMS). Currently my Research is focused on the 
Statistical Machine Learning and its applications.  

:warning: I am looking collaborators specifically for writing a Probabilistic 
Programming Language using JAX. If you are interested in this, please 
contact me.
